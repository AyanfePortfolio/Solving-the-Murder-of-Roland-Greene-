Solving the Murder of Roland Greene (SQL Investigation Project)

## Project Overview

This project is a data-driven SQL investigation into the murder of Roland Greene, a wealthy art collector found dead in his private vault room at exactly 8:00 PM. Although all 30 guests claimed to have alibis, database evidence reveals that at least one suspect is lying.

Using structured query language (SQL), this project analyzes access logs, call records, and forensic timelines to uncover contradictions, reconstruct events, and identify the prime suspect.
